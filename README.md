# AI Academy - Capstone Project
As part of the AI Academy program, this deliverable consitutes the final step of the learning process. The aim of this project is to both demonstrate that the concepts learned throughout this course have lent the developer a higher level of competence in the use of Machine Learning models, and that he/she is able to properly utilize the skills therein comprehended with the aim of providing value by helping solve a business need.

From the options presented by the instructor, the chosen dataset was "Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD)", available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/energy-anomaly-detection/data?select=test_features.csv.

## Business problem definition
The data in the Kaggle dataset offers a set of +50 columns that describe the energy consumption of various buildings as ***kilo-watt-hour*** logs. These logs, which logically appear hourly per building, are accompannied by surrounding descripting data, such as the footprint of the building, the primary use (i.e. Office, Parking), the temperature. More importantly, however, all logs are labeled for being an anomaly, or not.
In this project, it is presumed that the information belongs to a private energy supplying company. Further, energy consumption spikes have several negative impacts on operations of electricity suppliers, ranging from not being able to satisfy the demand, to having to buy local energy from thrid parties at an increased rate. Thus, a high-value proposal would include, as one of its main outcomes, the ability to respond more efficiently to such consumption spikes.

### Problem to solve
Given the available information, and labels, this project developed an end-to-end implementation of an XGBoost model with the following capabilities:
